The wizard will allow you to configure settings of the WebGL template to be loaded at build time. The preview image displays how the settings will appear once generated.

Once you are satisfied with the look you can select `Create Template`.  
    - If it doesn't exist, his will create a new directory in `/Assets/` called `/WebGLTemplates/`.  
    - All the settings will be copied over to the `Player Settings` template variables.  
    - Finally the `Player Settings` window will launch for any additional values to be configured.
